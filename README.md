# Rename
In this project, I use Python to quickly rename files in a designated folder.

## How to Use
1. Download the `rename.py` code and place in the folder with the files you want to rename.
2. Run the code and follow the prompts.
3. The code creates a folder called `/prev_files` that contains the files before renaming. This allows you to restore the files if required.

If you would like to test the code, the `create_test_files()` function will generate test .txt files in the `/files` folder for you to manipulate.
